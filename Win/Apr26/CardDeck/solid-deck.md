Use these existing classes to explain SOLID design principles, if any apply here.

The SOLID design principles are five principles of object-oriented design that aim to promote simpler, more robust, and updatable code. Here's how the existing classes relate to these principles:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have only one responsibility.

The PlayingCard class follows this principle because it is only responsible for representing a playing card. It doesn't have any other responsibilities.
The Deck class also follows this principle because it is only responsible for managing a deck of cards.
The TarotDeck class follows this principle because it is only responsible for creating a Tarot deck.
Open/Closed Principle (OCP): This principle states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification.

The Deck class can be extended by creating a new class that inherits from it, such as TarotDeck. This allows us to create different types of decks without modifying the Deck class itself.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): This principle states that subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.

The TarotDeck class is a subtype of Deck, and it can be used anywhere a Deck object is expected. This means that the TarotDeck class follows the LSP.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): This principle states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.

This principle doesn't apply directly to the given classes, but if we were to add more features to the Deck class that are not relevant to all types of decks, it might make sense to split the Deck class into smaller interfaces that can be implemented by different types of decks.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): This principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions.

The TarotDeck class depends on the Deck class, which is a higher-level abstraction. This means that the TarotDeck class follows the DIP.
In summary, the given classes follow the SRP, OCP, LSP, and DIP principles, but the ISP principle is not directly applicable in this context.
